Kebab Tycoon, an offline game in Atari 2600 graphic style

The goal of this experiment is to test the power of the Google AI Studio by having it create a game from a single prompt. It uses gemini 2.5 pro and, the game, was created on 22/07/2025. The prompt used is in Italian and was made with ChatGpt on the same day, but I will upload it to you in both Italian and English.

## Prompt translated into English using DeepL:

**Game title:** Kebab Tycoon

**Platform:** Offline, Atari 2600 graphic style

### Player objectives
